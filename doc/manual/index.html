<h1>Glidein based WMS</h1>

<br>

<h2>Description</h2>

The glideinWMS package holds the Condor glidein based Workload
Management System (WMS).<br>

<h2>The glidein mechanism</h2>

As the title says, this WMS is based on glideins. But what are <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the glideins</span>?<br>

<br>

A glidein is, simply put, a properly configured <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/3_1Introduction.html#SECTION00412000000000000000">Condor
Startd</a> submitted as a Grid job. <br>

Once the glidein starts on a worker node, it will join the the
specified Condor pool, making the obtained Grid-batch slot a slot in
the Condor pool. At this point, a regular Condor job can start there as
if was a dedicated resource. See the picture below for a schematic
overview.<br>

Condor glideins are a convenient way to expand a Condor pool. Apart
from the task of submitting new glideins as needed, everything else&nbsp;stays the same as in a dedicated pool.<br>

<h2>WMS Overview</h2>

The glidein based WMS is made of two pieces:<br>

<ul>

  <li>One or more glidein factories</li>

  <li>One or more VO frontends</li>

</ul>

The two pieces perform each a part of the job:<br>

<ul>

  <li>The glidein factories are the one that know about available
Grid sites and know how to submit glideins to them.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>The VO frontends are the ones that know about the VO job
specifics and know how many and what kind of glideins are needed. </li>

</ul>

The two pieces communicate via a common Condor Collector; see the image
below for a schematic view.<br>

A single WMS (identified by the Condor Collector) can serve multiple
frontends via multiple factories. It is a truly many-to-many system.
However, the current implementation does not support prioritzation
between different frontends, so it is best to have only one frontend;
multiple factories will instead work as desired.<br>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

Due to the amount of material avaialable, the documentation has been
split in several pages:<br>

<ul>

  <li><a href="factory/index.html">Glidein Factory</a></li>

  <li>Glidein Frontend</li>

</ul>

You will also need to install and maintain a Condor pool. The Condor
main page can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/</a>.<br>
