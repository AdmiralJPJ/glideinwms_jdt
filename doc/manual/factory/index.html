<h1>Glidein Factory</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

A&nbsp;Glidein Factory is a combination of a glidein entry point
and an actual factory process.<br>

The factory process advertises itself to a Condor Collector, gets work
from the same Collector and submits glideins as configured by the
glidein entry point.<br>

<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

The main task of the Glidein Factory is to listen for requests
from&nbsp;<a href="../frontend/index.html">frontend
clients</a> and submit glideins. Look at the picture
below for a schematic view.<br>

<br>

As can be seen from the above pictures, the factory daemon
itself&nbsp;publishes&nbsp;what kind of glideins it can submit.
A glidein kind is called a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="glidein_entry_point"></a>glidein entry point</span>,
as it usually points to a different Grid resource. <br>

<br>

A single glidein factory can handle multiple glidein entry points. For
each entry point, it will advertise a different class-ad. Similarly,
each request from a frontend client will affect a single entry point; a
frontend will need to advertise several requests in order to
have&nbsp;glideins submitted to all the desirable resources.<br>

<br>

Each entry point resides in a different&nbsp;directory. A glidein
entry point is completely self contained, and the factory does not need
to know anything about its internals. The factory only cares about the
list of parameters the entry point expects and the jobs submission
file; everything else is taken care by the glidein startup script. See
the picture below for an overview.<br>

<h2><a name="phylosophy"></a>The Glidein
Factory philosophy</h2>

Now that the basic overview of the factory was given, let describe the
philosophy behind the Glidein Factory.<br>

<br>

As said in the overview, the factory will serve requests from frontend
clients. Each request contains the required number of glideins needed and the glidein parameters.<br>
<br>
The main idea behind this is that a frontend has several (hundreds or
even thousands) of user jobs in the queue and is looking for resources
where to run them. The frontend does not want to handle the submission
of glideins but just asks the factory(s) for a certain amount of
glideins to be kept in the Grid queues, in order to get as many
resources as possible. If the frontend ever runs out of user jobs, it
will advertise that the factory(s) should not keep any more idle
glideins in the queues.<br>
