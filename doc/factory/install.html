        The installer will ask for several DNs for GSI authentication.  You have the option of using a service certificate or a proxy.  These should be
        created and put in place before running the installer.  The following is a list of DNs the installer will ask for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WMS Pool cert/Proxy DN</li>
            <li>Glidein Frontend Proxy DN (cannot use a cert here)</li>

    <h3><a name="before_install_misc">4.3 Miscellaneous Notes</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will need the OSG Client (formerly VDT client).  
You need to install it yourself using either the RPM or the tarball provided by OSG (see <a href="../components/prerequisites.html#system_vdt">here</a>).
<!--This can be handled one of two ways:
        <ul>
        <li>Install it yourself (see <a href="../components/prerequisites.html#system_vdt">here</a>). Specify 'n' in the ini file for installing the vdt.</li>
        <li>Have the installer install it for you via Pacman. Specify 'n' in the ini file for installing the vdt.</li>
        </ul>
-->
    </p>
    <p>By default, match authentication will be used. 
       If you have a reason not to use it, be sure to set to False the USE_MATCH_AUTH 
       attribute in both the Factory and Frontend configuration files.

    <h2><a name="condor">5. HTCondor installation instructions</a></h2>

    <p>
        Most required software is installed from the Factory RPM installation. HTCondor is the only exception since there are many different ways to install it, 
        using the RPM system or not. You need to have HTCondor installed before installing the GlideinWMS Factory. If yum cannot find a HTCondor RPM, it will 
        install the dummy empty-condor RPM, assuming that you installed HTCondor using a tarball distribution.

</div>

<div class="section">

    <h2><a name="factory">6. Glidein Factory installation guide</a></h2>

    <p>
        The Glidein Factory requires a proxy from the Frontend to use for submitting glideins. This proxy must (at any point in time) have 
        a validity of at least, the longest expected job being run by the GlideinWMS and not less than 12 hours.<br>
        How you keep this proxy valid (via MyProxy, kx509, voms-proxy-init from a local certificate, scp from other nodes, or other methods), 
        is beyond the scope of this document.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The Glidein Factory itself should be installed as a non privileged user</b>. The RPM installer will create the configuration
        file used to configure and run the Factory, although some manual tunning will probably be needed.

    <h2>7. Factory Management Commands</h2>

    <h3><a name="starting">7.1 Starting and Stopping</a></h3>
    <p>The Glidein Factory comes with a init.d style startup script.</p>
    <p>To start Glidein Factory, do </p>
    <blockquote>
        systemctl start gwms-factory</br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To stop Glidein Factory, do </p>
    <blockquote>
        systemctl stop gwms-factory</br>
    </blockquote>
	<p>You can check that the Factory is actually running with</p>
	    <blockquote>
            systemctl status gwms-factory
	    </blockquote>
	<p>To get the list of entries defined in the Factory, use</p>
	    <blockquote>
            gwms-factory info -entries -CE
	    </blockquote>
	<p>To see which entries are currently active, use</p>
	    <blockquote>
            gwms-factory statusdown -entry entries
	    </blockquote>
	
	<p>To see the status of the overall Factory, use</p>
	    <blockquote>
            gwms-factory statusdown -entry factory
	    </blockquote>
	<p>
	See the <a href="./monitoring.html">monitoring section</a> for more information and tools to monitor status.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

    <h3><a name="factory_update">7.2 Changing the Factory configuration</a></h3>

    <p>The files in an entry point must <b>never be changed by hand</b> after the directory structure has been created. The 
    reason why manual changes are so problematic are two fold:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>The first problem are signatures. Any change requires the
	    change of the signature file, that in turn gets a new signature.
	    Since the signature is one of the parameters of the
	    startup script, all glideins already in the queue will fail. </li>
	    <li>The second problem is caching. For performance reasons,
	    most Web caches don't check too often if the original document has
	    been changed; a glidein could thus get an old copy of a file and
	    fail the signature check. 
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is only one file that is neither signed nor cached and can
	be thus modified; the blacklisting file called <tt><b>nodes.blacklist</b></tt>.
	This one can be used to temporarily blacklist malfunctioning nodes
	that would pass regular sanity checks (for example: memory corruption
	or I/O errors), while waiting for the Grid site admin to take action.
	</p>

	<p>
	The proper procedure to update an entry point is to make a copy of the official configuration file 
	(i.e. <i>glideinWMS.xml</i>) as a backup.  Then edit the config file and run
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	    gwms-factory reconfig
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	This will update the directory tree and restart the Factory and entry dameons. (If the Factory wasn't running at the time of reconfig, it
	will only update the directory tree.)
	</p>
	<p>
	Please, notice that if you make any errors in the new configuration file, the reconfig 
	script will throw an error and do nothing. If you executed the reconfig command while the facotry was running, it will revert to 
	the last config file and restart with those settings.  As long as you use this tool, you should never corrupt the installation tree.
	</p>
	<p><b>NOTE</b>: The reconfig tool does not kill the Factory in case of errors.
	It is also recommended that you only disable any entry points that will not be used.  Never remove them from the config file.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="downtimes"></a>7.4 Downtime handling</h3>
	<p>The glidein Factory supports the dynamic
	handling of downtimes at the Factory, entry, and security class level.</p>

	<p>Downtimes are useful when one or more Grid sites are known to have
	issues (can be anything from scheduled maintenance to a storage
	element corrupting user files).<br>In this case the Factory
	administrator can temporarily stop submitting glideins to the
	affected sites, without stopping the Factory as a whole.
	The list of current downtimes are listed in the Factory 
	file in <tt>glideinWMS.downtimes</tt>
	</p>
	<p>Downtimes are handled with </p>
    <blockquote>
    gwms-factory
    up|down -entry 'factory'|&lt;entry name&gt; [-delay &lt;delay&gt;]
    </blockquote>

	<p>
	<b>Caution</b>: An admin can handle downtimes from Factory, entry, and security class levels. <br>
	Please be aware that both will be used.
	</p>

	<p>More advanced configuration can be done with the following script:</p>
    <blockquote>
      manageFactoryDowntimes.py
        <b>-dir</b> factory_dir 
        <b>-entry</b> ['all'|'factory'|'entries'|entry_name] 
        <b>-cmd</b> [command]
        [options]
    </blockquote>
    <p>You must specify the above options for the Factory directory, the entry
    you wish to disable/enable, and the command to run.  The valid commands
    are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> add           - Add a scheduled downtime period
        <li> down          - Put the Factory down now(+delay)
        <li> up            - Get the Factory back up now(+delay)
        <li> check         - Report if the Factory is in downtime now(+delay)
        <li> vacuum        - Remove all expired downtime info
    </ul>
    <p>Additional options that can be given based on the command above are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> -start [[[YYYY-]MM-]DD-]HH:MM[:SS] 
                (start time for adding a downtime)
        <li> -end [[[YYYY-]MM-]DD-]HH:MM[:SS]   (end time for adding a downtime)
        <li> -delay [HHh][MMm][SS[s]]           
            (delay a downtime for down, up, and check cmds)
        <li> -security SECURITY_CLASS  
            (restricts a downtime to users of that security class)<br/>
            (If not specified, the downtime is for all users.)
        <li> -comment "Comment here"   
            (user comment for the downtime. Not used by WMS.)
    </ul>
	<p>
    This script can allow you to have more control over managing downtimes,
    by allowing you to make downtimes specific to security classes, 
    and adding comments to the downtimes file.  
    </p>
    <p>
	Please note that the date format is currently very specific.
	You need to specify dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS",
	such as "2011-11-28:23:01:00."
    </p>
    
	<h3><a name="localtest"></a>7.5 Testing with a local glidein</h3>
		
		<p>In case of problems, you may want to test a glidein by hand.</p>
		<p>Move to the glidein directory and run</p>
		<blockquote>
		    ./local_start.sh <i>entry_name</i> fast -- GLIDEIN_Collector 
		    <i>yourhost</i>.dot,<i>your</i>.dot,<i>domain</i>
		</blockquote>
		<p>This will start a glidein on the local machine and pointing to the
		<i>yourhost.your.domain</i> collector.</p>
		<p>Please make sure you have a valid Grid environment set up,
		including a valid proxy, as the glidein needs it in order to work.</p>

        <p>You should see several condor_master and condor_procd processes.  You should also be able to see one

        <p>Verify GlideinWMS processes are running by:</p>
            <blockquote>
                ps -ef | grep <i>factory_username</i>
            </blockquote>
        <p>You should see also a main Factory process as well as a process for each entry.</p>
        <p>You can query the WMS collector by (use .csh if using c shell):</p>

            </blockquote>
            
        <p>The condor_q command queries any jobs by schedd in the WMS pool (-global is needed to show grid jobs).<br/><br/>
            The condor_status will show all daemons and glidein classads in the condor pool.  Eventually, there will be 
            glidefactory classads for each entry, glideclient classads for each client and credential, and glidefactoryclient classads 
            for each entry-client relationship.  The glideclient and glidefactoryclient classads will not show up unless a Frontend is
